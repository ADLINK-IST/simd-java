 * 
 * <b>Changeable:</b> Yes
 *

 * information to the created {@link Publisher} or {@link Subscriber}. The
 * value of the GROUP_DATA is available to the application on the
 * {@link DataReader} and {@link DataWriter} entities and is propagated by
 * means of the built-in topics.
 * 
 * This QoS can be used by an application combination with the
 * {@link DataReaderListener} and {@link DataWriterListener} to implement
 * matching policies similar to those of the {@link Partition}
 * except the decision can be made based on an application-defined policy.
