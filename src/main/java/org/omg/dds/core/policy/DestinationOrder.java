/**
 * Controls the criteria used to determine the logical order among changes
 * made by {@link Publisher} entities to the same instance of data (i.e.,
 * matching Topic and key). The default kind is
 * {@link DestinationOrder.Kind#BY_RECEPTION_TIMESTAMP}.
 * 
 * <b>Concerns:</b> {@link Topic}, {@link DataReader}, {@link DataWriter}
 * 
 * <b>RxO:</b> Yes
 * 
 * <b>Changeable:</b> No
 * 
 * This policy controls how each subscriber resolves the final value of a
 * data instance that is written by multiple DataWriter objects (which may be
 * associated with different Publisher objects) running on different nodes.
 * 
 * The setting {@link Kind#BY_RECEPTION_TIMESTAMP} indicates that, assuming
 * the {@link Ownership} allows it, the latest received value for
 * the instance should be the one whose value is kept. This is the default
 * value.
 * 
 * The setting {@link Kind#BY_SOURCE_TIMESTAMP} indicates that, assuming the
 * {@link Ownership} allows it, a time stamp placed at the source
 * should be used. This is the only setting that, in the case of concurrent
 * same-strength DataWriter objects updating the same instance, ensures all
 * subscribers will end up with the same final value for the instance. The
 * mechanism to set the source time stamp is middleware dependent.
 * 
 * The value offered is considered compatible with the value requested if and
 * only if the inequality "offered kind &gt;= requested kind" evaluates to
 * true. For the purposes of this inequality, the values of DESTINATION_ORDER
 * kind are considered ordered such that BY_RECEPTION_TIMESTAMP &lt;
 * BY_SOURCE_TIMESTAMP.
